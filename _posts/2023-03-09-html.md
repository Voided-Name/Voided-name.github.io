im messed up, I can give up family and my relationship for you, thats insane. I should get my head checked but all I know is I can be anything for you. And its insanely frustrating that I can't do that because of circumstances and chains. Maybe I shouldn't [REDACTED]

I think this distance is just perfect, so we can stay as long as possible.
