im messed up, I can give up family and my relationship for you, thats insane. I should get my head checked but all I know is I can be anything for you. And its insanely frustrating that I can't do that because of circumstances and chains. Maybe I shouldn't have had a relationship with [REDACTED] and fully commit myself to making you feel better. Platonic or not as long as its what you need. What should I do, I have no idea, do I need to distance myself away from you. Cus my emotions just deepen over time, man im shitty.

I think this distance is just perfect, so we can stay as long as possible.
