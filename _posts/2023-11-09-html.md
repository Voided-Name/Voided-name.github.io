# Intrinsic Goals

* What do I want to do with myself
    * finish studying
        * why? 
            * Satisfy parents
            * because it is necessary for me?
        * How do I enjoy the process
            * actually find value in what I do with quality... 
                
I need some more time with silence just with my own thoughts because I have been using the internet as a crutch for the things I think I should do and thoughts that I think about myself. Even this is something I am doing because of something I have seen in the internet.
